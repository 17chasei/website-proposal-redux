    <h2>About the site</h2>
    <p>The Written World is a site that seeks to teach people about writing systems and related subjects. You can expect a greater emphasis on writing systems that are ancient and/or of particular interest to me.</p>
    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>I am Isaiah and - as you may have guessed by now - I like writing systems. I also like linguistics in general. My favorite writing systems are Dongba (along with Geba), Eskayan, Egyptian hieroglyphs (along with Demotic and Hieratic), Cherokee, Old Uyghur, and the Paleohispanic scripts. My favorite language family is Trans-New Guinea. I'm currently learning Spanish.</p>
    <p>Another fun thing I like to do is <a href="transliterations.html">write English with other writing systems</a> (a process called "transliteration").</p>
