    <h1>The Written World</h1>
    <h2 id="homepage-subtitle">A compendium of the world's writing systems</h2>

    <p><span>Welcome to <b>The Written World</b>. </span></span>This website is dedicated to teaching about the many writing systems (or “scripts”) that exist in the world today. Despite writing only existing for a fraction of the time that language has, we've seen countless scripts spring up since they were first invented (in other words, for the more-or-less 100,000 years that we've been speaking, writing only came about a few millenia ago). Just like language, writing systems evolve, and this is evident in how we write today. It may be strange to consider, for example, that the <a href="egyptian.html">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> are the reason why the letters I’m using (and you’re reading) right now exist. This, however, is simply one of many incredible aspects of writing.</p>
    <p>Before you proceed, please note that you can <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">hover over text with dotted underlines to get more information on the underlined subject</span><span class="popup-content">It's true!</span>. If you’re interested in the <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">typological categories of writing</span><span class="popup-content">Some writing systems don't fit neatly into one typological category. For example, cuneiform and Chinese characters have elements of both a logography and syllabary, which is why they are sometimes called "logosyllabaries."</span>, consult the section “<a href="#types-of-writing-systems">types of writing systems</a>.” If you’re interested in using geographic regions as a starting point, consult the section "<a href="#writing-systems-by-region">writing systems by region</a>"; this section will redirect you to writing systems in the region of your choice and the typological categories that are found there.</p>
    <p>Finally, there's a small section at the bottom  titled "<a href="#other-stuff">other stuff</a>." It includes an <a href="about.html">about page</a> and other things that aren't completely relevant. It also has a whole bunch of <a href="transliterations.html">stuff about transliteration methods I've made</a>, so if you want to write English in a non-Latin writing system, then check that out!</p>

    <h2 id="types-of-writing-systems">Types of writing systems</h2>
        <p><a href="abjads.html">Abjads</a>: writing systems that tend to omit vowels, giving precedence to consonant letters. Examples include Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
        <p><a href="abugidas.html">Abugidas</a>: writing systems where vowels are indicated by modifications to a consonant letter. Examples include Tibetan and Ge'ez.</p>
        <p><a href="alphabets.html">Alphabets</a>: writing systems that tend to equally indicate both vowels and consonants. Examples include Greek and Latin.</p>
        <p><a href="ideographies-pictographies.html">Ideographies/pictographies</a>: writing systems that use abstract symbols to convey ideas (ideograms) and/or pictures to resemble what they refer to (pictograms). Examples include Blissymbolics and, more specifically, symbols like <em>@</em> and <em>&</em>.</p>
        <p><a href="logographies.html">Logographies</a>: writing systems that use symbols to represent words (logograms). Not to be confused with ideograms/pictograms, which don't refer to any specific word, but rather convey a more broad meaning. Examples include the Chinese and Mayan scripts.</p>
        <p><a href="semisyllabaries.html">Semisyllabaries</a>: writing systems that have elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Examples include Paleohispanic and Old Persian cuneiform.</p>
        <p><a href="syllabaries.html">Syllabaries</a>: writing systems where each syllable tends to have its own letter. Examples include Cherokee and Kana.</p>
        <p><a href="misc.html">Miscellanea</a>: writing systems and other subjects that don't quite fit into the other categories. Includes topics such as <em>proto-writing</em> and undeciphered scripts.</p>
