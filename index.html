    <h1>The Written World</h1>
    <h2 id="homepage-subtitle">A compendium of the world's writing systems</h2>
    <p><span>Welcome to <b>The Written World</b>. </span></span>This website is dedicated to teaching about the many writing systems (or “scripts”) that exist in the world today. Despite writing only existing for a fraction of the time that language has, we've seen countless scripts spring up since they were first invented (in other words, for the more-or-less 100,000 years that we've been speaking, writing only came about a few millenia ago). Just like language, writing systems evolve, and this is evident in how we write today. It may be strange to consider, for example, that the <a href="egyptian.html">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> are the reason why the letters I’m using (and you’re reading) right now exist. This, however, is simply one of many incredible aspects of writing. This homepage has two main categories that both ultimately link to the same subjects; this is done for the sake of convenience and navigation.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in the <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">typological categories of writing</span><span class="popup-content">Some writing systems don't fit neatly into one typological category. For example, cuneiform and Chinese characters have elements of both a logography and syllabary, which is why they are sometimes called "logosyllabaries."</span>, consult the section “types of writing systems.” If you’re interested in learning about the various genetic <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">"families"</span><span class="popup-content">Here, what qualifies as a family of writing systems is if it was invented independently of other systems. For example, I classify Mesoamerican as a family because these systems were not influenced by, for example, Chinese or Egyptian systems. Furthermore, I won't include <em>a priori</em> writing systems such as Georgian or Armenian since although most of their glyphs are not based on Greek, the principle of their function as an alphabet certainly is (such as their alphabetic order and certain letter combinations, or "digraphs").</span> and the places of origin of a writing system, check the section "families and birthplaces of writing systems".</p>
    <h2>Types of writing systems:</h2>
        <p><a href="abjads.html">Abjads</a>: writing systems that tend to omit vowels, giving precedence to consonant letters. Examples include Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
        <p><a href="">Abugidas</a>: writing systems where vowels are indicated by modifications to a consonant letter. Examples include Tibetan and Ge'ez.</p>
        <p><a href="">Alphabets</a>: writing systems that tend to equally indicate both vowels and consonants. Examples include Greek and Latin.</p>
        <p><a href="">Ideographies/pictographies</a>: writing systems that use abstract symbols to convey ideas (ideograms) and/or pictures to resemble what they refer to (pictograms). Examples include Blissymbolics and, more specifically, symbols like <em>@</em> and <em>&</em>.</p>
        <p><a href="">Logographies</a>: writing systems that often use abstract symbols to represent words (logograms). Not to be confused with ideograms/pictograms, which don't refer to any specific word, but rather convey a more broad meaning. Examples include the Chinese and Mayan script.</p>
        <p><a href="">Proto-writing</a>: early forms of writing that didn't convey specific semantic meaning, but moreso broad concepts, such as clan markers or religious symbols. Some would go on to become complete writing systems. Examples include the Jiahu symbols and proto-cuneiform.</p>
        <p><a href="">Semisyllabaries</a>: writing systems that have elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Examples include Paleohispanic and Old Persian cuneiform.</p>
        <p><a href="">Syllabaries</a>: writing systems where each syllable tends to have its own letter. Examples include Cherokee and Kana.</p>
    <h2>Families and birthplaces of writing systems:</h2>
        <p><a href="">China</a>: the Chinese script and its descendants.</p>
        <p><a href="">Egypt</a>: the Egyptian hieroglyphs and its descendants.</p>
        <p><a href="">Mesoamerica</a>: the Mesoamerican scripts and its descendants.</p>
        <p><a href="">Mesopotamia</a>: the Sumerian cuneiform script and its descendants.</p>
