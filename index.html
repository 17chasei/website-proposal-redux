    <h1>The Written World</h1>
    <h2 id="homepage-subtitle">A compendium of the world's writing systems</h2>
    <p><span>Welcome to <b>The Written World</b>. </span></span>This website is dedicated to teaching about the many writing systems (or “scripts”) that exist in the world today. Despite writing only existing for a fraction of the time that language has, we've seen countless scripts spring up since they were first invented (in other words, for the more-or-less 100,000 years that we've been speaking, writing only came about a few millenia ago). Just like language, writing systems evolve, and this is evident in how we write today. It may be strange to consider, for example, that the <a href="egyptian.html">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> are the reason why the letters I’m using (and you’re reading) right now exist. This, however, is simply one of many incredible aspects of writing.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in the <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">typological categories of writing</span><span class="popup-content">Some writing systems don't fit neatly into one typological category. For example, cuneiform and Chinese characters have elements of both a logography and syllabary, which is why they are sometimes called "logosyllabaries."</span>, consult the section “types of writing systems.” If you’re interested in using geographic regions as a starting point, consult the section "geographic regions of writing systems"; this section will redirect you to typological categories belonging to the region.</p>
    <h2>Types of writing systems</h2>
        <p><a href="abjads.html">Abjads</a>: writing systems that tend to omit vowels, giving precedence to consonant letters. Examples include Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
        <p><a href="abugidas.html">Abugidas</a>: writing systems where vowels are indicated by modifications to a consonant letter. Examples include Tibetan and Ge'ez.</p>
        <p><a href="alphabets.html">Alphabets</a>: writing systems that tend to equally indicate both vowels and consonants. Examples include Greek and Latin.</p>
        <p><a href="ideographies-pictographies.html">Ideographies/pictographies</a>: writing systems that use abstract symbols to convey ideas (ideograms) and/or pictures to resemble what they refer to (pictograms). Examples include Blissymbolics and, more specifically, symbols like <em>@</em> and <em>&</em>.</p>
        <p><a href="logographies.html">Logographies</a>: writing systems that often use abstract symbols to represent words (logograms). Not to be confused with ideograms/pictograms, which don't refer to any specific word, but rather convey a more broad meaning. Examples include the Chinese and Mayan script.</p>
        <p><a href="proto-writing.html">Proto-writing</a>: early forms of writing that didn't convey specific semantic meaning, but moreso broad concepts, such as clan markers or religious symbols. Some would go on to become complete writing systems. Examples include the Jiahu symbols and proto-cuneiform.</p>
        <p><a href="semisyllabaries.html">Semisyllabaries</a>: writing systems that have elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Examples include Paleohispanic and Old Persian cuneiform.</p>
        <p><a href="syllabaries.html">Syllabaries</a>: writing systems where each syllable tends to have its own letter. Examples include Cherokee and Kana.</p>
    <h2>Geographic regions of writing systems</h2>
        <p><a href="">Americas</a>: writing systems native to the Americas.</p>
        <p><a href="">Africa</a>: writing systems native to Africa.</p>
        <p><a href="">Asia</a>: writing systems native to Asia.</p>
        <p><a href="">Europe</a>: writing systems native to Europe.</p>
        <p><a href="">Oceania</a>: writing systems native to Oceania.</p>
