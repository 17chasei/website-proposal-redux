    <h2>What is an ideography/pictography?</h2>
    <p>An ideography is a form of writing that conveys meaning through abstract symbols that represent ideas. A pictography is a form of writing that conveys meaning through symbols that graphically represent what they refer to. For example, the "forbidden/no" sign (as seen above) is ideographic because it uses an abstract symbol to convey a sense of something that is not permitted; it is not based on a picture of "nothing." On the other hand, the traffic signal for pedestrians crossing is a person walking, which is a literal representation of what it describes, therefore it is pictographic.</p>
    <p>What these two forms of writing share is that they do not represent any specific words, but rather a more vague sense of ideas; there is no one way to translate what is conveyed. For instance, the red circle with a line (again as above) can convey a sense of "forbidden" or "not allowed" in an English speaker's mind, but in the mind of a Spanish speaker, it might be "<em>no se permite(n)</em>" or "<em>no</em> [<em>entrar</em>, <em>fumar</em>, etc.]."</p>
    <p>Regardless of your language, you can understand what is being conveyed by these symbols (assuming you've learned them before). It might be helpful to think of them as being "translingual," or going across linguistic boundaries.</p>
