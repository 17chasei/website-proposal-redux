    <h2>What is an abjad?</h2>
        <p>An <em>abjad</em> is a type of writing system that "prioritizes" consonantal letters over vocalic letters (relating to vowels). In other words, consonants are always written (like an alphabet), but vowels are often omitted, with certain exceptions. The word comes from a combination of the first four letters of the Arabic script (<u>a</u>lif ا, <u>b</u>aa ب, <u>j</u>eem ج and <u>d</u>aal د). To demonstrate how an abjad works, consider this example showing what English might look like if it was written in an abjad style: <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline"><em>hllo and wlcm t th wrttn wrld</em></span><span class="popup-content">"Hello and welcome to The Written World."</span>.</p>
        <p>One unfamiliar with abjads might wonder why writing systems that don't explicitly mark vowels would be used, considering that it could potentially leave the reader "guessing" what vowel goes where, if any. However, this does not usually prove to be a problem for readers for a few reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew, it's generally the case that dictionaries, texts for learners, and holy texts will mark all the vowels. So in this case, those who either grow up learning an abjad or learn it later eventually become familiar with reading without vowel markings (like "training wheels" for writing).</li>
            <li>Some languages that use abjads, such as Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic have grammatical systems that make "guessing" the vowels much easier than many other languages would allow. These languages (called the Semitic languages) rely upon a word-building system of triconsonantal roots (word roots that have three consonants, but not always three; e.g. the root for "king" in Semitic is M-L-K or some variation). Within these consonantal roots, vowels are inserted into various spaces between consonants, which can form words. For example, the Hebrew root S-F-R has a general meaning of "writing," but filling in this root with the right vowels forms actual words (thus, <em>sefer</em> (ספר)                means "book" and <em>sofer</em> (סופר) means "scribe").</li>
            <li>If you could read the vowel-purged English sentence above, you've demonstrated that abjads are not necessarily inefficient writing systems, even for non-Semitic languages like English. In fact, a lot of non-Semitic languages use abjads, such as Farsi, Pashto, and Urdu (all of which are related to English).</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I wrote earlier that there are certain exceptions to when vowels <em>are</em> written. Usually, abjads explicitly write what are known as "long vowels." Long vowels are simply variants of a vowel that are pronounced longer than their "short" counterparts (the short vowels being what are often omitted). However, some "long vowels" in certain languages (like modern Hebrew) aren't actually long at all. For example, in the Hebrew word <em>sofer</em> סופר, the o-vowel (represented here by the Hebrew letter <em>vav</em> ו) is explicitly written, but the e-vowel is not. Why? Because historically, the o-vowel would have been distinguished from its short counterpart and the e-vowel was short, but Hebrew no longer distinguishes vowel length, <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">so sometimes the o-vowel is written despite not being long.</span><span class="popup-content">The o-vowel isn't always marked by the vav. For instance, the Hebrew name Moshe משה (equivalent of the name Moses) does not have a vav for the o-sound. Also, while standard Hebrew does not make the distinction anymore, some dialects still do.</span></p>
    <p>Historically, this wasn't always the case with abjads. The first ever abjad - and one of the first ever writing systems - the Egyptian hieroglyphs, did not indicate any vowels at all, and neither did its earlier descendants, such as Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician. Furthermore, it should be noted that these vocalic letters, like the vav, originally only represented a consonant (or more specifically, a semivowel), but later began to also indicate (long) vowels that were pronounced <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">in the same place in the mouth as the semivowel.</span><span class="popup-content">In linguistics, this is called the "place of articulation."</span></p>
    <h2>Common features of abjads</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Short vowels (vowels pronounced shorter than their longer counterparts) are not written, except in educational (like a children's book or dictionary) or religious texts (like the Qur'an, Tanakh, etc.); these vowels are usually represented by marks above or below the consonant that the vowel follows</li>
        <li>Long vowels are usually indicated by a process known at <em>matres lectionis</em> ("mothers of reading" in Latin), which means that letters that indicate <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">sounds like /w/ or /j/</span><span class="popup-content">The letters between forward slashes are how sounds (more specifically, <em>phonemes</em>) are represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Here, /w/ is like the w in "<u>w</u>ill" and /j/ is like the j in "hallelu<u>j</u>ah."</span> can also indicate the vocalic equivalent of these sounds (thus, <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">/u:/ for /w/ and /i:/ for /j/)</span><span class="popup-content">/u:/ is like the oo in "s<u>oo</u>n" and /i:/ is like the ea in "<u>ea</u>st." The colon represents long sounds in the IPA.</span>. Some instances of matres lectionis are more arbitrary, however, such as the Hebrew letter <em>he</em> ה representing <span class="popup-trigger dotted-underline">vowels such as /a/ and /e/ in addition to its original value of /h/</span><span class="popup-content">The vowels /a/ and /e/ are pronounced like the Spanish a and e respectively. The sound /h/ is pronounced like the h in "<u>h</u>ello."</span></li>
        <li>Abjads are often written right-to-left, but some can be written in other directions, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs (which could also begin left-to-right or top-to-bottom vertically in certain inscriptions) or Sogdian (which later developed a tradition of writing top-to-bottom in vertical lines, which carried over to its decendant Old Uyghur)</li>
